This is a slightly updated version of the open source Prolific PL2303 USB
to Serial driver for Mac. 

Users of PL2303 devices on OS X should note that the official driver
(which can be downloaded from Prolific) seems to be rampantly buggy...

Original version at 
	http://osx-pl2303.sourceforge.net/ 
and 
	http://bitbucket.org/ddb/osx-pl2303/.

Changes:
* Merged the Sourceforge and BitBucket upstreams.
* Renamed from nl.bjaelectronics.driver.PL2303 to net.sourceforge.osx-pl2303 (and
  similarly for class names). 
* Removed all the PID/VID combos I can't test. Easy to add them back if you 
  need them (just duplicate one of the current ones in Info.plist). Only
  the default (067B/2303) remains. 
* Set all the OS version minimums to 10.6 (as I can't test older versions).
* Fixed some bugs that prevented 64-bit builds working. This necessitated
  some refactoring due to unspecified pointer/integer size assumptions.
* Fixed or silenced most of the compiler warnings.
* Update distribution packager.
* Add very hackish stubs for power management methods that seem to be required
  now (otherwise you get link/undefined symbol errors when loading the kext).
